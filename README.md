## Development Guidelines

### Project Organization
1. **Client Isolation:** Each client's work is completely isolated in their own directory
2. **Standardized Structure:** All clients follow the same directory structure for consistency
3. **Nested Repos:** Projects may contain their own git repositories within the monorepo
4. **Documentation:** Each project should have its own README and CLAUDE.md files

### File Management
- **Projects:** Active codebases and development work
- **Communications:** Email threads, meeting notes, call logs
- **Documents:** Contracts, SOWs, invoices, proposals
- **Strategy:** Roadmaps, planning documents, research

### Security & Privacy
- Client data is isolated and never shared between clients
- Sensitive information should be stored in environment variables
- Follow security best practices for each client's requirements
