## Overview
This proposal outlines a flexible monthly project arrangement designed to support Atomic Insights' growth and development needs through targeted, results-driven initiatives.

## How It Works

### Monthly Project Structure
- **Duration**: One month cycles (e.g., August 15th - September 15th)
- **Budget Range**: $3,000 - $5,000 per month
- **Scope**: 1-2 focused mini-projects per month

### Process Flow
1. **Pre-Month Planning**: Before each month begins, we collaborate to:
   - Define specific project deliverables
   - Agree on total budget within the $3k-$5k range
   - Set clear success metrics

2. **Project Execution**: Throughout the month:
   - Dedicated focus on agreed deliverables
   - Regular progress updates
   - Agile approach to address any emerging needs

3. **End-of-Month Delivery**:
   - Final deliverables presented
   - Payment due upon project completion
   - Planning session for next month's project

## What You Get: Mini AI Apps + Strategic AI Insights

Each month delivers:

### 1. Custom Mini AI Applications
- **Proof-of-concept AI apps** that demonstrate what's possible with modern AI
