# Next Steps for Pete

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Send Nick Requirements List
Define exactly what you need to get started:
- Number and types of extracurricular emails
- Website access requirements  
- Test data specifications
- API documentation needs

### 2. Review Existing Work
- Get access to the Miro board
- Review current agent implementation
- Understand their Django/gRPC setup
- Look at their email parsing prompt structure

### 3. Write Proposal
Include:
- Technical approach using Cloud Code
- Timeline (6 week estimate based on meeting)
- Deliverables at each phase
- Cost estimates if applicable
- Learning/collaboration plan for Nick

## Development Prep

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Set up matching stack
- PostgreSQL database
- Python/Django basics for API compatibility  
- Docker for containerization
- Terminal UI framework for prototype
```

### Architecture Planning
- Design subagent structure
- Plan API endpoints
- Define data models
- Create error handling strategy

## Key Design Decisions to Make

1. **Agent Framework**
   - Cloud Code native vs. external framework
   - How to structure subagents
   - Communication between agents

2. **Data Storage**
   - Match Peggy's schema vs. independent prototype
   - Structured vs. NoSQL approach for varied ECA data
   - Caching strategy for website data

3. **User Interaction**
   - Terminal UI design for prototype
   - Confirmation/QA flow
   - Error messaging approach

## Timeline Estimate

**Week 1:** Requirements gathering, environment setup
**Week 2-3:** Phase 1 - Program identification  
**Week 4-5:** Phase 2 - Item card creation
**Week 6:** Integration and documentation

## Collaboration Plan

- GitHub repo for code sharing
- Loom videos for complex explanations  
- Slack for quick questions
- Weekly sync meetings
- Pair programming sessions for teaching

## Questions for Nick

1. Access to existing codebase/API?
2. Sample data privacy concerns?
3. Production deployment requirements?
4. Performance/scale expectations?
5. Budget for external services (browser automation, etc.)?
