# Proposal: Claude Code-Based ECA Management System for Peggy AI

## Executive Summary

Nick, this proposal outlines a fixed-price, 30-day build to give you a working, extensible agentic workflow for extracurricular activity (ECA) management that you can both use and learn from. The system will run inside Claude Code and as a Dockerized API service, so you can inspect, operate, and extend it hands-on while building long-term capability in AI-native development.

## Deliverable

A GitHub repository that you can run within Claude Code and via Docker, containing:

- Orchestrated subagents for ECA management
- MCP servers (leveraging existing servers where appropriate, or custom-built and hosted for easy deployment and use)
- Reusable workflow patterns
- Educational documentation
- Practical examples
- Containerized service (Docker) exposing an HTTP API suitable to serve as a backend for a future UI
- Entire Claude Code orchestration environment packaged in Docker, with the ability to utilize the system from web or mobile devices via the exposed HTTP API

Note: The Month 1 deliverable is not intended to be customer-ready out of the box. It will be production-informative: a Dockerized API that acts as a solid backend foundation for a future frontend.

## Approach

### Philosophy

- **Claude Code as Platform:** Not building separate software, but leveraging Claude Code itself
- **Learning by Doing:** Nick learns agentic patterns while solving real problems
- **Practical Education:** Every component includes documentation on "why" and "how to extend"

## Timeline: 30 Days (4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Foundation

- Set up repository structure
- Create base agents (email reader, web researcher)
- Build first workflow (program discovery)
- Document initial patterns

**Deliverable:** Working email-to-program extraction pipeline

### Week 2: Core Parsing

- Add schedule extraction
- Normalize data structures for programs/events
- Add initial task identification

**Deliverable:** Structured outputs suitable for tasking and calendaring

### Week 3: Orchestration & API

- Build parent confirmation flows
- Implement calendar integration
- Stand up Dockerized service and HTTP API endpoints

**Deliverable:** Running Docker container exposing API for the core workflow

### Week 4: Hardening & Education

- Monitoring/logging basics
- Delegation/extensibility patterns
- Documentation and guided walkthroughs

**Deliverable:** Full Month 1 system with educational materials

## Educational Components

### What Nick Will Learn

1. **Decomposition:** Breaking problems into agent-sized tasks
2. **Orchestration:** Coordinating multiple agents
3. **Tool Selection:** Choosing appropriate MCP servers
4. **Prompt Engineering:** Writing effective agent prompts
5. **Workflow Design:** Creating reusable patterns

### How Nick Will Learn

- **Hands-on Usage:** Running real workflows
- **Guided Modification:** Making changes with support
- **Independent Building:** Creating new agents
- **Pattern Recognition:** Applying to other problems

## Collaboration Model

### Asynchronous Primary

- GitHub for code sharing
- Weekly Loom videos delivered 1 day prior to each review meeting, providing full context and demo of current progress
- Slack for quick questions (unlimited async communication for feedback)
- Documentation in repo

### Synchronous Support

- Weekly 1-hour review of progress (4 sessions during the 30 days)
- Pair programming for key concepts
- Problem-solving sessions
- Architecture reviews

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success

- ✓ Extracts programs with 90%+ accuracy
- ✓ Handles variety of ECA types
- ✓ Creates actionable item cards
- ✓ Integrates with calendar

### Educational Success

- ✓ Nick can modify existing agents
- ✓ Nick can create new workflows
- ✓ Nick understands agentic patterns
- ✓ Nick can apply to other domains

### Business Success

- ✓ Reduces parent time by 50%
- ✓ Provides template for future features
- ✓ Demonstrates AI-native approach
- ✓ Creates competitive advantage

## Investment, Terms & ROI

### Investment & Terms

- Fixed price: $5,000
- Duration: 30 days
- Reviews: Weekly 1-hour session (4 total)
- Pre-reads: Weekly Loom video shared 1 day prior to each review meeting
- Communication: Unlimited async feedback via Slack
- Proposed start dates: Aug 25, 2025 or Sept 8, 2025 (delivers in ~1 month)
- Payment terms: Payable upon completion

### Assumptions & Dependencies

- You will need an active Claude Max subscription ($100/month) to utilize the solution inside Claude Code; no additional API charges will be necessary.
- MCP servers will be sourced from existing open servers where feasible; when gaps exist, I will build custom MCP servers and host them for easy deployment and use.

### Expected Returns

1. **Immediate:** Working ECA solution you can run in Claude Code and as a Dockerized API
2. **Short-term:** You become proficient in agentic development patterns
3. **Long-term:** Peggy AI builds AI-native features faster
4. **Strategic:** Competitive advantage through AI-first approach

## Why This Approach

### Traditional Development Limitations

- Fixed logic, hard to adapt
- Requires full deployment pipeline
- Slow iteration cycles
- Limited learning opportunity

### Claude Code Advantages

- Dynamic, adaptable workflows
- Immediate testing and iteration
- Teaches while solving
- Future-proof architecture

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Risk:** Claude Code limitations
- **Mitigation:** Design modular system that could port to production

### Educational Risks

- **Risk:** Learning curve too steep
- **Mitigation:** Progressive complexity, extensive documentation

### Business Risks

- **Risk:** Solution doesn't scale
- **Mitigation:** Focus on patterns that work at any scale

## Next Steps

1. **Approval:** Confirm the approach and select a start date (Aug 25 or Sept 8, 2025)
2. **Subscription:** Ensure Claude Max plan is active ($100/month)
3. **Data Gathering:** Provide test emails/accounts (target within first week)
4. **Repository Setup:** Create initial structure
5. **First Workflow:** Build email extraction pipeline
6. **Iteration:** Weekly 1-hour reviews and adjustments

## Long-term Vision

This project creates:

1. **Immediate Solution:** ECA management for Peggy AI
2. **Capability Building:** Nick becomes agent architect
3. **Template Library:** Reusable patterns for any problem
4. **Competitive Edge:** AI-native thinking throughout Peggy AI

## Conclusion

This isn't just solving the ECA problem - it's teaching Nick to think in agentic systems. The skills learned here apply to:

- Product development
- Business operations
- Customer support
- Market research
- Team management

By the end, Nick won't just have a solution; he'll have a new way of thinking about building AI-powered applications.
