## Project Overview

### Unique Approach: Claude Code as the Platform
This is NOT a traditional software development project. We're building a **Claude Code-based agentic workflow system** that:
- Runs entirely within Claude Code environment
- Uses Claude Code as the primary orchestrator
- Employs specialized subagents for specific tasks
- Teaches agentic thinking through practical application

### Dual Purpose
1. **Solve the ECA Problem:** Build working solution for extracurricular management
2. **Educational Platform:** Teach Nick Gidwani how to build AI-native applications using agentic workflows

### Key Components
- **Primary Agent:** Claude Code orchestrator
- **Subagents:** Email reader, web researcher, schedule builder, etc.
- **MCP Servers:** Gmail, calendar, web scraping integrations
- **Custom Commands:** /analyze-eca, /extract-schedule, etc.
- **Workflows:** Program discovery, information extraction, monitoring

## Current Focus
Creating a Claude Code repository that Nick will use to:
1. Run agentic workflows for ECA management
2. Learn to decompose problems into agent-sized tasks
3. Understand orchestration and tool selection
4. Apply these patterns to other business problems

### Learning Outcomes
- Think in terms of agentic systems
- Build AI-native applications
- Apply to both Peggy AI product and business operations
- Become self-sufficient in creating new workflows
