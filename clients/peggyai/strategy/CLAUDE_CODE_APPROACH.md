# Claude Code-Based Agentic Solution for Peggy AI

## Project Reframing

This engagement is NOT about building a traditional software product for Peggy AI to deploy. Instead, we're creating a **Claude Code-powered agentic workflow system** that:

1. **Solves the ECA problem** using Claude Code as the orchestration layer
2. **Teaches Nick Gidwani** how to think about and build agentic workflows
3. **Provides a template** for future AI-native development at Peggy AI
4. **Demonstrates** how Claude Code can be used for complex business operations

## Core Concept

We're building a repository that Nick will run inside Claude Code, where Claude Code acts as the primary orchestrator with access to:
- Specialized subagents for specific tasks
- MCP servers for tool integration
- Custom commands and prompts
- Structured workflows for ECA management

## Architecture Overview

## Learning Objectives for Nick

### Immediate Skills
1. **Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into agent-sized tasks
2. **Orchestration** - Using Claude Code to coordinate multiple agents
3. **Tool Selection** - Choosing the right MCP servers and tools
4. **Prompt Engineering** - Writing effective prompts for subagents
5. **Workflow Design** - Creating repeatable agentic processes

### Strategic Understanding
1. How AI-native applications differ from traditional software
2. When to use agents vs. deterministic code
3. Cost/performance tradeoffs in LLM selection
4. Building trust through transparency and confirmation steps
5. Scaling agentic systems from prototype to production

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up base Claude Code repository
- Create initial subagent structure
- Implement basic email reading workflow
- Document patterns and decisions

### Phase 2: Core Workflows (Week 3-4)
- Build program extraction pipeline
- Add web research capabilities
- Create parent confirmation flows
- Integrate schedule generation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- Add monitoring agents
- Implement task extraction
- Create item card generation
- Build delegation patterns

## Educational Components

### For Each Subagent
- **Purpose Statement** - Why this agent exists
- **Design Decisions** - Why structured this way
- **Alternative Approaches** - Other ways to solve
- **Extension Points** - How Nick can modify/extend

### Documentation Structure
```
/docs
├── ARCHITECTURE.md - Overall system design
├── AGENT_PATTERNS.md - Reusable patterns
├── WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md - How to create new workflows
├── LESSONS_LEARNED.md - Key insights and decisions
└── EXTENSION_IDEAS.md - Future possibilities
```

## Key Differentiators from Traditional Development

### Traditional Approach
- Fixed code with predetermined logic
- UI-first development
- Database-centric architecture
- Deployment to production servers

### Claude Code Approach
- Dynamic agent orchestration
- Capability-first exploration
- Context-centric design
- Runs inside Claude Code environment

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- Nick can run the entire ECA workflow in Claude Code
- System successfully extracts program information
- Workflows are modifiable without breaking

### Educational Success
- Nick can create new subagents independently
- Nick understands when/why to use different patterns
- Nick can apply concepts to other business problems

## Practical Applications Beyond ECA

This approach teaches Nick to use Claude Code for:
1. **Business Operations** - Automating startup tasks
2. **Market Research** - Analyzing competitor information
3. **Customer Support** - Building support workflows
4. **Product Development** - Testing and iterating on features
5. **Team Management** - Creating operational workflows

## Next Steps

1. **Align with Nick** on this Claude Code-centric approach
2. **Create initial repo structure** with example agents
3. **Build first workflow** (email → program extraction)
4. **Document patterns** as we discover them
5. **Iterate based on Nick's learning** and feedback

## Key Insight

This isn't just solving Peggy AI's ECA problem - it's teaching Nick how to think about and build the next generation of AI-native applications. The ECA use case becomes a practical classroom for understanding agentic workflows that can be applied across his entire business.
